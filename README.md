### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- Successfully implemented glide.js, which can be more technically challenging than others like slider.js
- Created a site using React and Router, the latest technologies that we've learned at Turing
- Stuck to our original layout design despite tricky formatting issues


Some wins included:
- Implementing a several new forms of tech can be tedious as we had to slowly work our way through our notes and documentation, rather than relying on past experience
- Glide.js can be difficult to work with and probably took more time than a different option would have
